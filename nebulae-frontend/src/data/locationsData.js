      2: "These plants are extremely drought-tolerant once established and require no supplemental watering. They thrive in full sun and well-drained, rocky, or sandy soil. Overwatering is detrimental and can cause root rot.",
      3: "The Brittlebush's silvery leaves are covered in tiny hairs that reflect sunlight, reducing water loss and leaf temperature. A large bloom of Desert Marigolds can be so dense it turns entire hillsides yellow, a phenomenon sometimes called a superbloom."
